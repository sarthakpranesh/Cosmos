## What is Cosmos?
<p>
Cosmos is an open source Social Media platform. The project aims to provide a dedicated box like platform for it's users where they can have dedicated spaces for their  friends, family, work circle, etc. We achieve this by utilizing Boxes. Inside of each box you add users by there email that are relevant to that box. This helps you focus and share content in groups (boxes) where that content would matter the most.

|Comments |Click the message/comment icon on the right of the post and start a discussion |Reactions sometime aren't able to disclose what an individual might have to share with others on the topic, hence they can leave a comment let other know what they feel or want to share |
